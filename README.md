## üìå Assignment Highlights

### ‚úÖ **Assignment 1 ‚Äì Linear Regression**
- Built single- and multi-feature linear regression models using **gradient descent from scratch**
- Tuned learning rates and visualized loss curves
- Evaluated feature contribution individually and in combination

### ‚úÖ **Assignment 2 ‚Äì Regularization & Optimization**
- Introduced **L2 regularization** to prevent overfitting
- Performed feature scaling and normalization
- Analyzed impact on convergence and cost functions

### ‚úÖ **Assignment 3 ‚Äì Classification Models**
- Implemented and compared **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM**
- Visualized performance via **confusion matrices** and **classification metrics**
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality and optimize performance
